# Project Brief: SubTranslate

## Overview

SubTranslate is a web application designed to automatically extract subtitles from video files and translate them into the user's desired language.

## Core Requirements

- **Video Upload:** Users can upload video files from their local machine.
- **Subtitle Extraction:** The system will use an AI service (like Whisper) to transcribe the audio from the video into text with timestamps.
- **Language Translation:** The extracted subtitles will be translated into various languages using an LLM service (like Gemini).
- **Display and Download:** Users can view the video with the translated subtitles and download the subtitle file (e.g., in SRT format).

## Goals

- To provide a fast and accurate subtitle generation and translation service.
- To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- To build a scalable and maintainable application using modern web technologies.
