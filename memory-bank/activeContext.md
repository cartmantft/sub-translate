# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- **UI Implementation:** The current focus is to connect the created components and display them on the main page.

## Recent Changes

- **Project Structure:** The initial file and folder structure has been created, including API routes, components, and library files.
- **Dependencies:** `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` were installed to support the `cn` utility function.
- **Environment:** The `.env.local` file has been created with placeholder keys.

## Next Steps

1.  **Integrate Components:** Import and render the `FileUploader` and `VideoPlayer` components in the main `page.tsx`.
2.  **Implement Basic State Management:** Create state to handle the video source URL for the `VideoPlayer`.
3.  **Test UI:** Run the development server to ensure the basic UI components are rendering correctly.
4.  **Implement Supabase Client:** The `supabase.ts` file is created, but it needs to be properly integrated and used.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Project Name:** The project name was changed from "SubTranslate" to "sub-translate" to comply with npm naming conventions.
- **Bundler:** Turbopack was selected for the `next dev` server during setup. This is a performance enhancement for development.
